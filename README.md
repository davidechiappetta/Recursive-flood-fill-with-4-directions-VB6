From Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill:<BR>
Flood fill, also called seed fill, is a flooding algorithm that determines and alters the area connected to a given node in a multi-dimensional array with some matching attribute. It is used in the "bucket" fill tool of paint programs to fill connected, similarly-colored areas with a different color, and in games such as Go and Minesweeper for determining which pieces are cleared. A variant called boundary fill uses the same algorithms but is defined as the area connected to a given node that does not have a particular attribute.

### step step until filling all square white
#### note the rotation of two small square: up, left, down, righ
#### the small square blue is the current state, the small square green is the next state

### Code for the recursion, uncomment the call to viewPosition() for understanding the logic of the recursion, or comment it for matter of speed.
